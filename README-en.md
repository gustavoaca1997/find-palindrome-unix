In the following project, a program was developed to determine if palindromes exist in a directory tree. The program must print the palindromes it found, or "They do not exist." otherwise. In addition to the implementation of the respective algorithms to navigate the directory tree and the verification of the existence of palindromic character strings, a child process, a pipe and signals were used to satisfy the requirement of communication and synchronization of processes.
